This is a test-project with cypress-based UI-tests. The test-specs include the requested test (demoblaze.com), as well
as a couple of tests, which perform validation of errors.

The tests run well in UI-mode. To run them, first do ```npm install```, and then execute ```cypress open```, pick
'Chrome' browser, and click on a spec you want to run.
